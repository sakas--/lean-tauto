Lean-tauto
---
A (simplified) `tauto` tactic for [Lean Theorem Prover](http://leanprover.github.io) inspired by that of Coq.
It should be complete wrt intuitionistic propositional logic.  
Note that Lean is under development and this code may not work with the latest (or a particular) version of Lean.
